The goal of this class is to create wrapper functions for various '''nltk''' and other libraries to make explatory data analysis of texts in English and french more easily done within a Jupyter notebook. Some functionality that I would like to see:

    * The ability to take a text, and in a single line create a word cloud.
    * Easily create data displays of substring frequency in the text. 
    * Show distribution of paragraph and sentence length.
    * Easily show the the word frequencies in the text.
    * Determine the grade level of various texts.
